Hence, the Mongolian Beef recipe was born. (But, as Judy and the girls would say, that's just my crazy theory/the ramblings of an old coot!).Anyway, chalk it up to Chinese-American menu planners and marketers who dubbed the dish “Mongolian Beef.”It's a close cousin to “Singapore Noodles,” a dish that many actual Singaporeans scratch their heads over most likely born in the stainless steel kitchen of a Chinese takeout joint!"

I was scrolling through old posts the other day, looking for grilling recipes to make this weekend, when I rediscovered my dad's recipe for Char Siu on the grill. Now, that recipe WAS pretty brilliant.If you're not familiar, Char Siu is a savory, slightly sweet barbecued pork popular in Cantonese cuisine. If you've ever walked past a Cantonese restaurant in whatever Chinatown happens to be nearest you, you've probably seen it in metal pans underneath fluorescent lights and the roast ducks hanging in the window."

I was scrolling through old posts the other day, looking for grilling recipes to make this weekend, when I rediscovered my dad's recipe for Char Siu on the grill. Now, that recipe WAS pretty brilliant.If you're not familiar, Char Siu is a savory, slightly sweet barbecued pork popular in Cantonese cuisine. If you've ever walked past a Cantonese restaurant in whatever Chinatown happens to be nearest you, you've probably seen it in metal pans underneath fluorescent lights and the roast ducks hanging in the window."

Hence, the Mongolian Beef recipe was born. (But, as Judy and the girls would say, that's just my crazy theory/the ramblings of an old coot!).Anyway, chalk it up to Chinese-American menu planners and marketers who dubbed the dish “Mongolian Beef.”It's a close cousin to “Singapore Noodles,” a dish that many actual Singaporeans scratch their heads over most likely born in the stainless steel kitchen of a Chinese takeout joint!"

I often use the seasoned seaweed to add flavours in soup, sometimes cook soups with the unflavoured ones, that normally comes in dried sheet form.Just soak a sheet of seaweed in water until it softens. After rinsing thoroughly, it's ready to cook with other ingredients I like."
